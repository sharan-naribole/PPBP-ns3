	 * \ingroup PPBP
	 *
	 * \brief Generate traffic to a single destination according to a
	 *        Poisson Pareto Burst Process (PPBP).
	 *
	 * The PPBP is a process based on the overlapping of multiple bursts
	 * with heavy-tailed distributed lengths [1], [2].
	 * Events in this process represent points of time at which one of an
	 * infinite population of users begins or stops transmitting a traffic burst.
	 * The PPBP is closely related to the M/G/Infinity queue model.
	 *
	 * In the PPBP model, bursts arrive according to a Poisson process with rate lambda_p,
	 * and their length follows a Pareto distribution characterized by Hurst parameter
	 * H, typically between 0.5 and 0.9, and a mean Ton. Each burst is modeled by a
	 * flow with a constant bit-rate r. Then, the overlapping bursts form in
	 * aggregate a Long-Range Dependent traffic provided the burst length have
	 * infinite variance.
	 *
	 * Summary of parameters:
	 * - - - - - - - - - - -
	 * lambda_p:	mean rate of burst arrivals
	 * Ton:			mean burst time length
	 * r:			Burst intensity
	 *
	 * Based on Littles law, the average number of active bursts is given by:
	 * E[n] = Ton x lambda_p
	 * Since each burst gives birth to a flow with a constant bit-rate, it is then
	 * straightforward to compute the overall rate of the PPBP, lambda:
	 * lambda = Ton x lambda_p x r
